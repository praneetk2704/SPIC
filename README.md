# SPIC
A basic .exe file created in C++ through which CPI and SPI of any student from our college (NIT Silchar) can be calculated.

You'll be asked to choose either of the two to calculate in the main menu.

Supposing you chose SPI, it will ask you your branch and semester, and accordingly your subjects will show up. Enter your expected pointer in all of your subjects. You will get your calculated CPI.

If you further wish to calculate something, press 'y' else 'n'.
Supposing you press 'y', you'll again be asked to calculate CPI or SPI. If you choose CPI, your current semester will be asked. Accordingly, enter your SPI for all your previous semesters and the CPI you're expecting this semester. The calcualted CPI will be shown.
